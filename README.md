# minesweeper
A minesweeper clone programmed in python using Tkinter. The aim for this project is to act as a pre-requisite to another project I plan on making: A hard-coded bot to play minesweeper, an a self-learning AI.


## TODO:
- Add in timer (MAYBE)
- Fix flag bug (something to do with positions and counting of mines left)
- Add in win condition
- Board generation is slightly wrong

## DONE:
- Add in auto unveil through empty squares, up to the first instance of a non zero in all directions
- Mine counter
- Add in mine marking
- Ensure the first click is NEVER a mine, generate buttons beforehand in this case.
